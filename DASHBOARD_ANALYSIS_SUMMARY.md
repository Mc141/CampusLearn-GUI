## 🔧 **Issues Fixed**

### **1. Data Property Mismatch**

- **Problem**: Dashboards were accessing `topic.subscriber_count` (snake_case)
- **Solution**: Updated to `topic.subscriberCount` (camelCase) to match service mapping
- **Files Fixed**: `StudentDashboard.tsx`, `AdminDashboard.tsx`

### **2. Navigation Route Issues**

- **Problem**: Admin Dashboard was navigating to non-existent routes (`/admin/users`, `/admin/security`, `/admin/analytics`)
- **Solution**: Updated navigation to point to existing routes:
  - `/admin/users` → `/admin/escalations`
  - `/admin/security` → `/forum/moderation`
  - `/admin/analytics` → `/notifications`

### **3. Service Integration**

- **Verified**: All services exist and are properly implemented
- **Verified**: All data mapping is correct
- **Verified**: Error handling is comprehensive
