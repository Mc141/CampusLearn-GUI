# Voting System Fix - Summary

## Problem

The voting system had a critical bug where users could like posts an unlimited number of times, leading to inflated vote counts and poor user experience.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Level Changes (`fix_voting_system.sql`)

#### Added Unique Constraints

- `forum_post_votes`: Added `unique_forum_post_vote` constraint on `(post_id, user_id)`
- `forum_reply_votes`: Added `unique_forum_reply_vote` constraint on `(reply_id, user_id)`
- `answer_votes`: Added `unique_answer_vote` constraint on `(answer_id, user_id)`
- `question_votes`: Added `unique_question_vote` constraint on `(question_id, user_id)`

#### New Database Functions

- `toggle_vote()`: Handles like/unlike functionality with proper vote counting
- `has_user_voted()`: Checks if a user has already voted on an entity
- `get_vote_info()`: Returns vote count and user vote status

### 2. Service Layer Updates

#### Forum Service (`src/services/forumService.ts`)

- Replaced `upvotePost()` and `upvoteReply()` with `togglePostVote()` and `toggleReplyVote()`
- Added `getPostVoteInfo()` and `getReplyVoteInfo()` for checking vote status
- Functions now return `{ voteCount: number; hasVoted: boolean }`

#### Answers Service (`src/services/answersService.ts`)

- Replaced `upvoteAnswer()` with `toggleAnswerVote()`
- Added `getAnswerVoteInfo()` for checking vote status

#### Questions Service (`src/services/questionsService.ts`)

- Replaced `upvoteQuestion()` with `toggleQuestionVote()`
- Added `getQuestionVoteInfo()` for checking vote status

#### Answer Reply Service (`src/services/answerReplyService.ts`)

- Replaced `upvoteReply()` with `toggleReplyVote()`
- Added `getReplyVoteInfo()` for checking vote status

### 3. Frontend Component Updates

#### Forum Page (`src/pages/ForumPage.tsx`)

- Updated `upvotePost()` to `togglePostVote()` with proper user ID handling
- Changed tooltip from "Upvote" to "Like"

#### Post Details Page (`src/pages/PostDetailsPage.tsx`)

- Updated `upvotePost()` and `upvoteReply()` to toggle functions
- Changed tooltip from "Upvote" to "Like"

#### Questions Page (`src/pages/QuestionsPage.tsx`)

- Updated `handleUpvote()` to `handleToggleVote()` with proper service integration
- Added proper error handling

#### Nested Reply Component (`src/components/NestedReply.tsx`)

- Updated `handleUpvote()` to `handleToggleVote()` with user ID validation

#### Answer Replies Component (`src/components/AnswerReplies.tsx`)

- Updated `handleUpvote()` to `handleToggleVote()` with user ID validation
- Added proper user authentication checks

## Key Features

### ✅ Toggle Functionality

- Users can now like/unlike posts by clicking the same button
- First click: Adds a vote (like)
- Second click: Removes the vote (unlike)

### ✅ Duplicate Prevention

- Database constraints prevent multiple votes from the same user
- Service layer validates user authentication before processing votes

### ✅ Real-time Updates

- Vote counts update immediately in the UI
- Proper error handling for failed vote operations

### ✅ User Experience

- Clear visual feedback with "Like" tooltips
- Consistent behavior across all voting interfaces
- No more unlimited voting abuse

## Usage Instructions

1. **Apply Database Changes**: Run the `fix_voting_system.sql` script in your Supabase database
2. **Test the System**:
   - Try liking a post multiple times (should toggle)
   - Verify vote counts are accurate
   - Test across different components (forum posts, replies, questions, answers)

### Services
