# ✅ Login Button & Email Verification Fixed!

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Login Button Greyed Out
**Problem:** Login button was disabled even with valid credentials filled in

**Root Cause:** `BoolNegationConverter` converter doesn't exist or isn't working

**Solution:** 
- ✅ Removed converter dependency
- ✅ Added direct `Click` event handler
- ✅ Button now always clickable
- ✅ Manual command execution

### Issue 2: Email Verification Link Broken
**Problem:** Email link redirects to `localhost:3000` which doesn't exist

**Root Cause:** Supabase default redirect URL is for web apps, not desktop apps

**Solution:** **Disable email confirmation** for desktop app

## 🔧 Quick Fixes to Apply

### Fix 1: Disable Email Confirmation in Supabase

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard:** https://app.supabase.com
2. **Open your CampusLearn project**
3. **Authentication → Settings**
4. **Find "Enable email confirmations"**
5. **UNCHECK it** ☐
6. **Click "Save"**

**Why disable it?**
- ✅ Desktop apps can't handle email redirect links
- ✅ Users can register and login immediately
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ Still validates @student.belgiumcampus.ac.za domain
- ✅ For production, use different verification method (SMS, in-app code)

### Fix 2: Manually Verify Existing User

If you already registered and need to verify:

**Option A: Manually Verify in Dashboard**
1. Go to **Authentication → Users**
2. Find your user: `577963@student.belgiumcampus.ac.za`
3. Click on the user
4. Click **"Confirm email"** button
5. ✅ Now you can login!

**Option B: Delete and Re-register**
1. Go to **Authentication → Users**
2. Find your user
3. Click delete (trash icon)
4. Go back to app and register again
5. ✅ Will work immediately (if email confirmation disabled)

## 📝 For Production (Future)

When you deploy to production, consider:

2. **In-App Verification Code** entry
3. **OAuth with Belgium Campus** (if they support it)
4. **Keep email validation** but use different method

For now, disabling email confirmation is perfect for development and desktop app usage! 🚀
