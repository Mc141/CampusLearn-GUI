# ✅ Create Account Button - Fixed & Enhanced

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Issue
The "Create Account" button appeared to be unclickable and unresponsive.

### Root Causes Identified
1. **PasswordBox Binding Issue**: PasswordBox `Password` property binding doesn't work reliably in WinUI/Uno Platform
2. **Converter Missing**: `BoolNegationConverter` might not be available
3. **Command Not Executing**: Command binding might be failing silently

### Solutions Applied

#### 1. Added Direct Click Event Handler
```csharp
private async void OnRegisterButtonClick(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    // Manually executes RegisterCommand
    // Logs all form values for debugging
}
```

#### 2. Fixed PasswordBox Binding
```csharp
private void OnPasswordChanged(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    // Manually updates ViewModel.Password when user types
}
```

#### 3. Enhanced Debug Logging
- Logs button click
- Logs all form values (Email, FullName, Password)
- Logs command execution status
